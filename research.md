## [ILLIXR](https://illixr.github.io)
Worked with Professor Sarita Adve's group for 2 years on the ILLIXR Extended Reality benchmark and runtime. This benchmark enables full system profiling and prototyping for systems and architecture researchers working in AR/VR/XR. I helped with the early design of the runtime and contributed to building out the build and dependency management system. I also worked on porting [OpenVINS](https://openvins.com), a Visual Inertial Odometry system, to our runtime. In addition, I profiled OpenVINS using the runtime and other tools (linux perf and Intel VTune) for architecture insights that coud be used for a custom SLAM/VIO accelerator.
