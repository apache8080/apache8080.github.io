The goal of HackIllinois was to get more students to contribute to Open Source so I worked with other team members to find Open Source contributors/maintainers to come to the event as mentors. I also helped plan events during the hackathon to entertain both hackers and maintainers.</p></li></ul></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container><p>Made in California by Rishi Desai.</p>©
