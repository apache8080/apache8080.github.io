## Organizations

- ### [ACM@UIUC](acm.illinois.edu)
  I was a member of the Illinois ACM student chapter for 4 years. During that time I serverd as the Vice Chair of ACM during the 2018-2019 school year and for 2 years I was the lead of ACM projects where we worked on many of the projects [here](https://github.com/acm-uiuc).

- ### [HackIllinois](https://hackillinois.org/)
	I helped plan HackIllinois 2018 and 2019; specifically focused on the hacker and mentor experience during the event. The goal of HackIllinois was to get more students to contribute to Open Source so I worked with other team members to find Open Source contributors/maintainers to come to the event as mentors. I also helped plan events during the hackathon to entertain both hackers and maintainers.
