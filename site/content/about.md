I am Rishi Desai, a sophomore studying Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. Currently I am a Software Engineering Intern at Cisco working on software defined networking. Previously at Blueberry Home, NVIDIA, and 2 [FIRST Robotics Competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/) (FRC) teams, I worked on scaling web services, building robot systems in ROS (Robot Operating System), and designing real time motion control systems. In addition to programming, I am huge Bay Area sports fan, which I sporadically blog and consistently tweet about. I also love spending times outdoors on my bike or more recently skateboarding, and I enjoy playing basketball and soccer with my friends.

## Projects

### Robotics Projects

[**Project Hedwig**](https://github.com/apache8080/hedwig) - Currently working on converting a [Traxxas Slash 1/10 Pro 2WD Truck](https://traxxas.com/products/models/electric/58034-1slash) into an autonomous car using ROS, an Arduino UNO, and an [NVIDIA Jetson TX1](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems-dev-kits-modules/). This project is based off of the [MIT RACECAR](http://fast.scripts.mit.edu/racecar/) project.

[**MotionProfileLib**](https://github.com/Team5677Robotics/MotionProfileLib) - A Java Library that computes 2D trajectories and motor profiles for a skid-steer FRC Robot during the [2017 FRC game, Steamworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRST_Steamworks). The generated trajectory is passed through a control loop running at 100Hz using the [WPILib Notifier Library](http://first.wpi.edu/FRC/roborio/release/docs/java/).

[**FRC Target Tracking**](https://github.com/apache8080/FRC_VisionTracking_2016) - A OpenCV blob tracker written in Python for [2016 FRC game, Stronghold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRST_Stronghold). This script tracks finds the center of the goal and then calculates the robots offset angle and streams the data to the robots controller via a UDP socket. 

[**Jetson T-Shirt Shooting Robot**](https://github.com/apache8080/NVIDIABot) - Converted a FIRST FRC robot into a robot fully run by the NVIDIA Jetson TK1 with ROS and Python. Project was sponsored by NVIDIA. [Here is a video of the robot in action!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkMDzctFkO0)

### Open Source Projects

[**ACM GPU Cluster**](https://github.com/acm-uiuc/gpu-cluster) - Built the docker container management system for the GPU cluster that allows users to have GPU access from a jupyter notebook running in a docker container. This project uses the nvdocker python library we made to create and run docker containers with GPU access. I am currently one of the mentors. 

[**nvdocker**](https://github.com/acm-uiuc/nvdocker/) - nvdocker is library built on top of the docker-py python sdk to build and run docker containers with GPU access using nvidia-docker. I am currently one of the maintainers.

[**gonum**](https://github.com/gonum/gonum/pull/525) - First contribution to a large open source project. Wrote the Yen K-Shortest Path algorithm for their graph implementation in golang.

## Organizations

[**ACM@UIUC**](acm.illinois.edu) - I joined ACM@Illinois in 2017 and was a contributing member on many [ACM Projects](github.com/acm-uiuc). Currently, I am the Vice Chair for the 2018-2019 School year, and I continue to lead the ACM Projects team.

[**IlliniHackers**](https://twitter.com/illinihackers) - This is a group within ACM that helps run many side events around HackIllinois. The main side event we run are HackNights; during HackNights, we bring an OpenSource project and some mentors to work with students for a night on solving issues and building features. I also manage the twitter page for IlliniHackers.

[**HackIllinois**](https://hackillinois.org/) - I have been a member of the Experience team since HackIllinois 2018. On the Experience team, I help design the Open Source experience for mentors and hackers at the event to make sure they get the opportunity to build some awesome Open Source projects.

[**PyData Champaign Urbana**](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-CU/) - I Co-Founded PyData Champaign Urbana in 2018. We are sponsored by [NumFOCUS](https://www.numfocus.org) and run bi-weekly meetups for people interested in Data Science, R, Julia and Python.
