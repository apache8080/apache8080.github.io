Currently I am a Software Engineer at [Anduril Industries](https://anduril.com). I studied Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Most of my programming interests are in building systems software (Operating Systems, Compilers, etc.) to enable Robotics, AR/VR, and other spatial compute.

In addition to programming, I am a huge Bay Area sports fan, which I consistently tweet about. I also enjoy spending time outdoors on my bike or skateboard, and playing basketball and soccer.
